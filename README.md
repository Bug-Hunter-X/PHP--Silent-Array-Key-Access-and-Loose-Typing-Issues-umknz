This repository demonstrates two subtle but common errors in PHP:  

1. **Silent Array Key Access:** PHP does not throw an error when accessing a non-existent array key.  This leads to the return of `null`, which can cause problems if not handled correctly.

2. **Loose Typing Issues:** Functions not explicitly validating parameter types can encounter silent type conversions, leading to unpredictable behavior.

The `bug.php` file showcases these issues.  The `bugSolution.php` demonstrates a safer approach to prevent these types of problems.
