In PHP, a common yet easily overlooked error arises when dealing with array keys.  If you attempt to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, PHP will not throw an error, but instead, return `null`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard-to-debug issues if not handled carefully. For example, consider this code snippet:
```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
echo $myArray['c']; // Outputs nothing
```
This code silently returns `null`, and further operations on this `null` value might produce errors or inaccurate results.  The issue is further complicated when using `null` in conditional statements, as `null` is often considered equivalent to `false` which can lead to unexpected logical flow.

Another less obvious issue happens with loosely typed variables.  Functions expecting specific data types can unexpectedly behave differently if provided with unexpected data types. This might lead to subtle errors that are hard to track down. For example, consider a function expecting a string as a parameter; if an integer is passed, it can lead to silent conversion and unpredictable results.
